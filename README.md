# Classification-Project--Predicting-Customer-Churn

### Project Overview
In today’s commercial world, there is high competition and every customer is valuable. One of the biggest expenditures of any organization is customer churn. Customer churn also known as customer attrition or customer turnover is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company’s product or service within a specified timeframe. For instance, if your company began the year with 1000 customers but later ended with 900 customers, the percentage of customers that churn will be 10%. If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold.
The aim of this project was to find the likelihood of a customer leaving a telecom organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.
